# Real-time Object Recognition

This project uses PyTorch and YOLO to perform real-time object recognition through your webcam.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the main script:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Features
